Introducing ipHV > Intel Port Horo-Vault — Contract.
Intel Port Horo-Vault (ipHV) is a smart contract developed by Intel Port Contract Security (IPCS) under the Intel Port Foundation—ipHV is designed to lock your ETH into the ipHV contract for a period of time of your choosing. The goal is to secure your ETH over time, making it useful for saving without disrupting your money management—especially when sudden expenses arise.

> Once locked, all you need to do is > wait—Simple!

Is it secure? Yes, the secure element we use is simple. Your personal ethereum wallet address—the one that sends ETH to the ipHV contract—is the only key to your ETH on the ipHV contract, even before it gets locked. As long as you have access to your personal ethereum wallet address, your ETH remains secure. However, in another word: if you lose your personal ethereum wallet address, you lose access to your ETH on ipHV contract.
We cannot help recover it in any way—there is no backdoor, no workaround. The security is absolute.
